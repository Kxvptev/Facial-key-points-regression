# Facial-key-points-regression
Facial key points prediction using Regression CNN with STN implemented on PyTorch.

Check .ipynb to know more about data I have used, model architecture, to know how my net copes with different face images.

In this repository, there is no data on which I trained the model and there are no saved model weights, since it all takes a little more than 2 GB. If you need data or a saved model, write to me, I will send it in archive
